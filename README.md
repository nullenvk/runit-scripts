# Runit scripts
This is my personal collection of various runit init scripts and tools. 

## Init scripts
* hddmount - mount encrypted HDDs as soon as they become available
* runsvdir-user - permits an user to run runit scripts in their home directory
* irc - an autostarting irssi session (use it as an user service)

## Utils
* svmon.sh - Real-time monitor of services running in user's svdir
