# Runit scripts
This is my personal collection of various runit scripts. 

## Script Descriptions
* hddmount - mount encrypted HDDs as soon as they become available
* runsvdir-user - permits an user to run runit scripts in their home directory
* irc - an autostarting irssi session (use it as an user service)
